  <p>With the click of a remote, opening of an app or lifting of a computer screen, Americans are now redefining what it means to watch television.</p>

  <p>Data shows while the number of homes with a television has increased to 119.9 million this season, the number of homes with “Pay TV,” households subscribing to traditional television services such as cable or dish, are decreasing toward a projected 95 million in 2020. In a trend known as cord-cutting, some viewers are cancelling these Pay TV services largely in favor of Over-the-Top, referred to as OTT, content. </p>

  <p>Seventy-one percent of internet users use OTT services, according to the Video Advertising Bureau’s 2018 first quarter report.</p>

  <p>OTT content is, “premium long form video content that is streamed over the internet through an app or device onto a TV (or PC, Tablet or Smartphone) without requiring users to subscribe to a wired cable, telco or satellite TV service,” according to the same report. OTT content includes on-demand services, such as Netflix, and live-streaming content, such as Sling, which can be accessed through connected devices and streaming services.</p>

  <p>With both traditional and digital options for viewing content, today’s television landscape sees disparities in content consumption across demographics and in quantity, now with an altered trajectory for the television industry moving forward.</p>

  <p>When asked what would cause users to terminate a cable or satellite television subscription, 46.4 percent of the Limelight Networks’ study said continued price increases, while 19.5 percent said once they can subscribe to only the channels they are interested in online. Others cited more sports content or complete access to desired content as possible future motivations. Some users, 12.8 percent, said they would never terminate their cable or pay TV subscription.</p>

      <h2 class="subhead">Adults who subscribe to cable</h2>
      <h3 class="sub-subhead">Percentage based on population in each age group </h3>

  <p>These motivations may be hitting different generations differently.  When asked by the Morning Consult in association with the Hollywood Reporter about whether they are currently or ever have had a cable subscription, the highest rate of current subscribers was aged 65 years and older at 57 percent of the population. The 30- to 44-year-old population had the highest rates of having been formerly subscribed, at 39 percent. Out of all of the age breakdowns, those aged 18 to 29 years old had the highest rate of never having been subscribed with a rate of 25 percent.</p>  
      <h2 class="subhead">Hours spent binge-watching shows</h2>
      <h3 class="sub-subhead">Time spent watching an online show in one sitting </h3>

      <p>Online viewers are also binge-watching content, with an average time of 2.93 hours, higher than the global average of 2.11 hours. In the U.S., 36.2 percent of viewers are watching one to three hours of a series in one sitting. The U.S. also holds the highest rate of watching more than 10 hours of content compared to the other countries surveyed, with a rate of 4.8 percent of the American population.</p>

      <p>While a large number of Americans are still subscribed to Pay TV services, trends indicate younger generations are moving to OTT content at higher rates and this content is being watched for longer spans of time.</p>
